   <p><a href="http://music-encoding.org" title="MEI Webseite" target="_blank">The Music Encoding Initiative (MEI)</a> as an XML based encoding format builds an essential component in the Digital Humanities.
      Currently, MEI is used in an increasing amount of projects in the field of digital
      scholarly music editions. Encoding of music and corresponding metadata in MEI is done
      within an XML environment, facilitating structured and flexible possibilities to store
      and use such data.</p>
   <p>This introduction to MEI is addressed to MEI beginners as well as to slightly advanced
      users. It is assumed, that attendees  have basic knowledge about the concept behind
      XML encodings and that they are familiar with music notation. Attendees are invited
      to take a tour through the <a href="http://music-encoding.org/support/MEI1st" target="_blank">MEI 1<sup>st</sup></a> tutorial. To be able to follow the practical exercises in this course it is recommended
      to have a laptop with at least a demo version of the oXygen XML editor, which can
      be obtained <a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/register.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
