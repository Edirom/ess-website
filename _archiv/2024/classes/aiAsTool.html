Artificial intelligence is now everywhere, but how can we use it effectively at work? It's not about AI doing our work entirely or even replacing us, but about how we can meaningfully integrate AI as a tool into our work. This can be done to gain more time in our professional lives or to increase efficiency for certain workflows. The course provides an overview of various AI tools and how they work.
