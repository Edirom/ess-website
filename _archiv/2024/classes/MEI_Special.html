    <p>This tutorial will provide the foundation for encoding tablature for string instruments in MEI. First, we will explore the most basic concepts – applying to all forms of tablature for string instruments – at the hand of modern guitar tablature. With an understanding of these basic concepts, we will proceed to more in-depth ones, whose realisation we will demonstrate using the more complex Renaissance lute tablature. We will focus primarily on French lute tablature, the most prevalent type in the surviving sources of lute music. If time permits, we will also look into the other types of lute tablature.</p>
    <p>We will learn how to encode all of these concepts in MEI – beginning with the most basic ones, such as core elements of the fretboard, and then gradually moving to more complex concepts, such as elements capturing rhythmic information, ornamentation, or fingering. We will verify that the same set of elements can be consistently used, regardless of the type of tablature.</p>
    <p>The tutorial will contain a hands-on session, in which we will encode examples illustrating the different types of tablature notation, both for guitar and lute. We will learn how to validate the encoded examples against the MEI schema for tablature notation. We will also learn about useful MEI-related tools and software packages that support tablature notation (e.g., <a href="https://mei-friend.mdw.ac.at/" target="_blank">mei-friend</a>, <a href="https://luteconv.mdw.ac.at/" target="_blank">luteconv</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/fronimo/home" target="_blank">Fronimo</a>).</p>
    <p>You are encouraged to bring examples you are interested in!</p>
