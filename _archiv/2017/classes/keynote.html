   <p>
      						In itself a polysemic word, modelling is considered to be a or the core research
      methodology in Digital Humanities.
      						In many other research contexts, modelling is understood as a research strategy
      and, in particular,
      						a process by which researchers make and manipulate external representations
      to make sense of objects and phenomena.
      						The widespread use of computers in modelling (in Digital Humanities in particular)
      tightened up but also freed the constraints of formal modelling.
      						Even when contextualized within strictly implementation-oriented settings, formal
      or rule-based and informal or story-based models co-exist and interact to give sense
      to our modelling efforts.
      						One way of explaining modelling processes is to unpack the interaction across
      objects of study, languages of scholarship and of software development, and the models
      being created. 
      					</p>
   <p>
      						Building on the collaborative work undertaken as part of the project «Modelling
      between digital and humanities: thinking in practice» (funded by the Volkswagen Stiftung,
      2016–2017),
      						this keynote will reflect on (digital) modelling practices within the context
      of music research and musicology.
      						Examples will be taken from the projects conducted at King’s College London
      and in some cases currently maintained by King’s Digital Lab.
      						At least three layers of analysis will be proposed: modelling the materiality
      of musical sources as objects of study;
      						modelling data structures to facilitate human and computational analysis and
      interpretation;
      						modelling the interfaces of digital and hybrid publications as new objects (models)
      of experience.
