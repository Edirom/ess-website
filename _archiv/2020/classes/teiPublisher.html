   <p>Moving from encoded XML sources to the published digital edition has always been a
      weak spot for the TEI community. TEI Publisher, an eXist-db based application using
      the TEI Processing Model principles helps to address this challenge and make creation
      of standalone digital editions possible out of the box with a focus on standardization,
      data exchange and sustainability. 
      The Processing Model based on TEI/ODD metalanguage provides an abstraction layer that
      governs the transformation of the TEI source into output formats like PDF, HTML or
      ePub. Switching to a web components based design allowed us to bring easy to customize
      HTML templates into the picture so adjusting the layout of the published edition can
      be reduced to moving around small blocks of HTML, not unlike playing with LEGOs. 
      
      Customising the appearance of the text in TEI ODD was proven to easily save thousands
      of lines of code for media specific stylesheets. New web component based templates
      offer similar advantages thanks to a growing library of components to just plug into
      new applications - from faceted search to IIIF viewer. 
      The proposed workshop intends to introduce the main concepts behind the TEI Publisher
      and provide a tutorial on how to create a custom standalone edition using it.</p>
