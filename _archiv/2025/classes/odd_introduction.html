            title="Getting Started with P5 ODDs" target="_blank">ODD (‘One Document Does it all’)</a> is a meta-language developed by the TEI, with which the formal description of a TEI or MEI schema can be created as well as its human-readable description in prose form, following the ‘Literate Programming’ approach. An ODD document itself is a regular TEI file (only extended by the tagdocs module) so that with a little experience in TEI, special schemas can be developed and customised for your own project relatively quickly.</p>
    <p>In this course, the concept of ODD as well as the underlying module and class systems of MEI and TEI will be introduced and then a first own schema will be created with the help of the Roma web editor. A further part will deal with the writing of the schema documentation (= electronic editorial guidelines), for which the ODD document will be further developed ‘by hand’.</p>
