    <p>This hands-on workshop introduces participants to Docker, the leading containerization platform used by developers and operations teams to build, ship, and run applications in isolated environments. Aimed at beginners, this session covers essential concepts such as images, containers, Dockerfiles, and volumes. Attendees will learn how to use existing Docker images for their work and how to containerize a simple application themselves.
        Through practical examples and guided exercises, participants will explore key Docker concepts including the client-server architecture, container lifecycle, image creation, volume management, and basic networking and commands. By the end of the workshop, participants will be equipped with the foundational knowledge needed to start using Docker in real-world development workflows.
