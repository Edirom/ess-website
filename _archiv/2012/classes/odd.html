    <h3>Dozenten: Raffaele Viglianti und Peter Stadler</h3>
    <h5>Zeit: Freitag, 28. 9., 9:00 bis 17:30 Uhr</h5>
    <h5>Raum: F1.406</h5>
    <p>
        This one-day workshop intends to give a fundamental overview on the TEI
        ODD meta language. ODD is both used to describe the formal specification
        of one's XML schema as well as the prose description of the according
        encoding practice (i.e. guidelines). While it can be edited through the
        Roma web interface but also by hand, both ways will be presented during
        the course of the workshop. This workshop will be held in English.
