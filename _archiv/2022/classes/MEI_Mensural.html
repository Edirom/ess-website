    <p>This tutorial will give you the basics for encoding early music in MEI. It will focus primarily on mensural notation, used in polyphonic music from the Renaissance and the Late Middle Ages. We will begin with an introduction to mensural notation. Here, you will learn about the different mensural note shapes, the concept of mensuration (i.e., meter), and the concepts of imperfection and alteration needed to provide the complete rhythmic information of a note. Then we will look into how these concepts are encoded in MEI. We will have a hands-on session to encode a few examples of various manuscripts illustrating the different characteristics of the notation. All examples will be validated against the MEI schema for mensural notation. You will also learn about some MEI-friendly tools that have support for mensural notation (e.g., <a href="https://editor.verovio.org/">Verovio Editor</href>, <a href="https://www.aruspix.net/">Aruspix</a>, <a href="https://muret.dlsi.ua.es/muret/#/home">MuRET</a>, and the <a href="https://editor.measuringpolyphony.org/#/">Measuring Polyphony Editor</a>)</p>
    <p>If time permits, we will also look into how to encode neume notation in MEI, another early music notation used for monophonic music. You are more than welcome to bring examples you are interested in.</p>
